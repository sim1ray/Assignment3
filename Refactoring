1. Created separate classes for implementing file menu functions (FileManager) and edit menu functions (EditProperties)
so as to decouple GUI from functionality, and thus make the classes smaller, reusable and object oriented.

2. FileManager & EditProperties classes: Extracted methods for new file, print file, open file, open recents, copy,
paste, replace to make it more readable, modular, and maintainable.

3. Lines 55-61: Separately added an ActionListener for each menu option to get rid of if-else block and to make it easier
to add newer functionality.

4. Removed first three lines of code for "paste" because it was unnecessary and did not add to the functionality.

5. Removed "undo" components because it was unused code.

6. Lines 76-81: Created new method addToMenu() to reduce repetition of code for adding a separator.

7. Entire program: Changed variable names to more descriptive ones: mb -> menu, em -> editMenu, fm -> fileMenu,
d -> display, nf -> newFile, sf -> saveFile, pf -> printFile, c -> copy, p -> paste, pjob -> printerJob.

8. Lines 20-26: Made menu components private because they should not be accessible from outside the class.

9. Entire program: Added comments to make the code more readable and understandable to the client.
